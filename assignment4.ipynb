    "In this assignment, you will examine how to use regressions to analyze data.  In particular, you will approach several problems using a data set that represents bluegill data instances randomly sampled from Lake Mary in Minnesota.  The researchers (Cook and Weisberg, 1999) measured and recorded the data in the file (fish.txt).  You will use regression analysis to build models to conduct predictions. You are required to use **polyfit** and **polyval** in numpy library as we learned in the lectures. **If you use any other libries, your solutions will not get any points.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you will need to include markup and code cells in this notebook so that you can address questions based on the plots generated from the different problems. In your submitted document, you need to include the created visualization plots by running your code in the notebook. Even if you believe your plots are wrong, you stil need to answer the question according to your plots/code and thoughts, and you can include an explanation of what you think should have happened. Make sure you answer the questions in full sentences.\n"

Given the data points you have, you need to build three models: a line model, a perabela model, and a cubic model using the **polyfit** function in the numpy library. When making predications using a model resulted by polyfit, you are required to use **polyval**. For each of the three regression models you build, you need to compute the R-squared value for the model and plot the data along with the fit curve.\n",
